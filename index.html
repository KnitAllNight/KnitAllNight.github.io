            <h3>Knitting and Quilting</h3>
            <p>My primary craft is knitting. I've been knitting for 15 years and it's something I do almost every day. I love to learn new techniques and nothing is too difficult!</p>
            <p>I always have a few projects on the needles. Preferably, one easy project to take with me anywhere and a more intricate project that doesn't leave the house. The easy project right now is a pair of socks for my son. His feet are bigger than mine, so they won't be a quick knit, but right now it's just knitting in the round with some increases. My intricate project is a two-color brioche shawl. It's so smooshy! Brioche is probably my favorite fabric and technique. Fun to knit, fun to smoosh.</p>
            <p>Another one of my crafts is quilting. I'm making a twin+ size quilt in just 2 fabrics, a blue and a yellow. The pattern looks like interlocking square chains. Not long ago I finished a reversible quilt. Each quilt square is made and with both the front and the back at the same time. Typically, an entire quilt top is sewn then it's sandwiched with batting and backing and finally quilted. Quilting each square was much easier since it's small, but assembling them was trickier. But the finished project is really nice!</p>

            <p>My name is Elizabeth. I live in San Francisco with my husband of 20+ years and our two kids, 9 and 14. Growing up, my mother and grandmother sewed and crocheted and taught me those skills at a young age. Now I knit, quilt, weave, and do some paper and vinyl crafts.</p>
            <p>The number and variety of supplies I use is enormous! Trying to find places for everything in our little house can be tough.<br>Current projects are in baskets next to the couch or in my purse/backpack<br>Hibernating projects are in a cubby in the craft room<br>Paper, vinyl, pens, markers, and more are stored in a small set of drawers<br>Books about knitting are in my grandmother's antique bookcase<br>Quilting books are in cubbies near the sewing machine<br>Yarn is in its own, much larger set of cubbies</p>
